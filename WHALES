TOWARDS THEE I ROLL, THOU ALL-DESTROYING BUT UNCONQUERING WHALE; TO THE LAST I GRAPPLE WITH THEE; FROM HELL'S HEART I STAB AT THEE; FOR HATE'S SAKE I SPIT MY LAST BREATH AT THEE.
IT IS NOT DOWN ON ANY MAP; TRUE PLACES NEVER ARE.
ALL MY MEANS ARE SANE, MY MOTIVE AND MY OBJECT MAD.
YES, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, MEDITATION AND WATER ARE WEDDED FOR EVER.
AS FOR ME, I AM TORMENTED WITH AN EVERLASTING ITCH FOR THINGS REMOTE. I LOVE TO SAIL FORBIDDEN SEAS, AND LAND ON BARBAROUS COASTS.
CALL ME ISHMAEL.
SOME YEARS AGO—NEVER MIND HOW LONG PRECISELY—HAVING LITTLE OR NO MONEY IN MY PURSE, AND NOTHING PARTICULAR TO INTEREST ME ON SHORE, I THOUGHT I WOULD SAIL ABOUT A LITTLE AND SEE THE WATERY PART OF THE WORLD.
IT IS A WAY I HAVE OF DRIVING OFF THE SPLEEN AND REGULATING THE CIRCULATION.
